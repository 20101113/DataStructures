# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains various Java solutions to common data structure and algorithm problems. Each file demonstrates a different technique or algorithm with an explanation of its logic.

## Contents:

- **Matrix Operations**
- **Other Algorithms**

## Algorithms:

### 1. **BubbleSort.java**
   - Implements the **Bubble Sort** algorithm, which repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if necessary until the array is sorted.

### 2. **CoinChangeDP.java**
   - Solves the **Coin Change problem** using dynamic programming, determining the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount.

### 3. **Duplicates.java**
   - Arranges numbers in order and removes duplicates, ensuring the final array contains unique values.

### 4. **FibonacciSeries.java**
   - A program to generate the **Fibonacci Series** using both recursive and iterative methods.

### 5. **InsertionSort.java**
   - Implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm, where elements are inserted one by one into their correct position in a sorted portion of the array.

### 6. **LeadersInArray.java**
   - Finds the **leaders in an array**, where an element is considered a leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right.

### 7. **LeftRotate.java**
   - Performs **left rotation** on an array by a specified number of positions, shifting the arrayâ€™s elements to the left.

### 8. **MoveZeroesSimpleSwap.java**
   - Moves all **zeroes** in an array to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements using a simple swap method.

### 9. **PairWithSum.java**
   - Finds pairs of elements in an array that add up to a specified sum.

### 10. **PrefixSumExample.java**
   - Demonstrates the **prefix sum** technique, where an array is transformed into cumulative sums for efficient range sum queries.

### 11. **ReverseWordsWithStack.java**
   - Reverses the **words in a sentence** using a stack, keeping the order of the characters in each word intact.

### 12. **SearchInMatrix.java**
   - Implements an efficient algorithm to **search for a target element** in a sorted 2D matrix.

### 13. **SelectionSort.java**
   - Implements the **Selection Sort** algorithm, which selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

### 14. **SingleLoopSecondLargest.java**
   - Finds the **second largest element** in an array in a single loop.

### 15. **StringAnagram.java**
   - Checks if two **strings are anagrams** by comparing the frequency of characters in both strings.
